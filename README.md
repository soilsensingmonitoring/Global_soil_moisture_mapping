# Global_soil_moisture_mapping

Here is the R code and ancillary data for generating surface soil moisture maps at 100-m and 6-12 days intervals within selected region of interest (ROI) at the global scale. Example data are provided for a sample study field reported in Huang et al. (2020). Users who want to generate maps of surface soil moisture at other regions of the world should prepare the input covariate data in the format as provided in the example. Google Earth Engine could be used to speed up the downloading and pre-processing of input Sentinel-1 and land surface parameter data. More details about the model performance and usage can be found at:
